# Retail Orders Analysis for 2022 and 2023

This project focuses on an in-depth analysis of a dataset containing retail orders for the years 2022 and 2023. The dataset is representative of various retail businesses such as supermarkets and delivery services. The goal of the project is to uncover valuable insights that can drive business decisions and improve operational efficiency.

### Step 1: Data Exploration and Cleaning
Initially, the dataset was thoroughly explored to understand its structure, identify missing values, and detect any anomalies.
The cleaning process involved:
Removing Unnecessary Columns: Columns that did not contribute to the analysis were removed.
Adding Useful Columns: New columns were introduced to enhance the dataset's analytical value. These included:

Discount: Calculated to understand the impact of discounts on sales.

Sale Price: Computed to reflect the final selling price after discounts and cost price.

Profit: Determined to evaluate profitability.


### Step 2: Advanced Data Analysis using SQL
To perform more sophisticated analyses, the cleaned dataset was imported into an SQL server. Various SQL queries were executed to generate insightful metrics and summaries, including:

Total Sales and Profit: Aggregated sales and profit figures to identify top-performing products and categories.

Monthly and Yearly Trends: Analysis of sales trends over time to detect seasonal patterns.

Customer Behavior: Insights into customer purchase patterns and their impact on sales.

Profit Margins: Calculation of profit margins to assess the financial health of different product lines.


### Step 3: Result Synthesis and Visualization
The results of the SQL queries provided a comprehensive view of the business's performance. Key findings included:

Top Categories and Products: Identification of the most profitable categories and products.

Sales Growth: Year-over-year comparison of sales growth to measure business expansion.

Customer Insights: Understanding customer preferences and their effect on sales and profit margins.

Operational Efficiency: Highlighting areas where cost optimization could enhance profitability.


### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data analysis, starting from data cleaning and enhancement to advanced SQL-driven analysis. The insights derived from this project can help retail businesses optimize their operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive profitability.
